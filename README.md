# Terminal Wordle Clone

This was a quick project to practice my Python skills. 

The game can be played in English or in French.

It was developed using python version 3.9.7 and should work on any python version 3+

## How to use

in your terminal, navigate to the terminal-wordle folder and run
```
python wordle
```
or 
```
python3 wordle
```
